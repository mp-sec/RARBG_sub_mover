# RARBG_sub_mover
A simple script that moves subtitles put in the SUBS folder on a RARBG rip into the main directory, and then deletes the empty SUBS folder. This is a personal file, so it is made only to move a single English .srt file or paired English .sub and .idx files. The format that it looks for is a string of text and then four-digit year within parenthesis around it. This would look like: Movie Name (1900)

If you want to change this for your own PC, alter the cwd variable to have the path for the folder containing your media. 

Additionally, FileBot is a program that can be downloaded from SourceForge to automate the renaming for me. I suggest the same to others. Different versions of the program can be found from this link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/filebot/files/filebot/.
